# torchains5
TorChain5 is a simple Bash script that allows you to execute any command-line tool through the Tor network, by transparently routing the command through a SOCKS5 proxy (e.g., an external Tor relay). It leverages proxychains to tunnel all traffic, including DNS, via the configured Tor proxy, ensuring anonymous communication from the terminal.
